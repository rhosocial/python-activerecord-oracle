"""activerecord_oracle local models for cross-schema tests.

Schema qualification is dialect-specific, so these live in this repository
rather than the shared testsuite. Each backend owns its fixtures and cases:
qualification syntax, whether a column reference may carry a namespace at
all, and how a namespace is created all differ between PostgreSQL, SQL
Server, Oracle, MariaDB (schema == database), BigQuery (dataset) and
Snowflake (three-level). A shared contract would assert the lowest common
denominator and stop catching the dialect-specific mistakes.
