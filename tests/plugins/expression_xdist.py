# tests/plugins/expression_xdist.py
"""Default the expression test area to parallel when it is the only target.

The org rules (expression-dialect §12.1) make pytest-xdist parallel the
default configuration of the expression test directory. The worker count,
however, is read by pytest-xdist before any conftest loads -- a conftest
cannot inject ``-n`` -- so the default lives in this repository-local
plugin, registered from ``pyproject.toml`` with ``-p
plugins.expression_xdist`` and therefore active for every run in this
repository.

The plugin is deliberately narrow in what it touches:

* **Availability**: with pytest-xdist not installed it enables nothing --
  installation is not this plugin's business, and the run proceeds serially
  the way it always has.
* **Scope**: only when every non-option argument names a path inside the
  expression area (``feature/backend/expression``) is ``-n auto`` appended.
  A whole-repository run, a mixed run, or a run of any other directory keeps
  the serial default; the live scenario tests have their own parallel
  runner (``--scenario-parallel``) and are not dragged into a worker pool
  they did not ask for. That boundary matters more here than elsewhere: the
  expression area is the only part of this backend's suite that is pure
  construction and rendering, with no connection and no session state to
  keep straight, so it is the only part where parallel is free.
* **Choice respected**: an explicit ``-n`` / ``--numprocesses`` is never
  overridden. An explicit ``--dist`` is never overridden either, except
  that ``loadscope`` and ``loadfile`` are refused outright (§12.1: they
  bind whole modules together and hide case-to-case dependencies).
  ``-n`` without ``--dist`` gets ``--dist=loadgroup`` appended, because
  loadgroup is the one scheduling the rules allow.

An ``xdist_group`` marker is the escape hatch for a case that genuinely
needs to run beside its neighbours, and the rule asks that its reason be
written where the marker sits rather than left implicit.
